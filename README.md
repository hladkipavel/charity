# **Charity**
This is application the objective of the project is to create a place where everyone will be able to give away unnecessary things to trusted institutions.

## Introdution
* The user has at home things he does not use, but they are in good condition and wants to pass them on to people who can be useful - but he does  not know how to do it in a simple way.
* There are many solutions available, but many of them require additional effort or they do not arouse trust.
In the verified places you have to go, and there is no time or there is no way to go there. On the other hand, containers under the house or local collections are unverified and it is not known whether these things will actually go to the needy.
